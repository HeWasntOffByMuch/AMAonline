! IMPORTANT - clean up all the getData()'s - this is touched in a couple of places like entities



- lose xp on death? lose eq on death?

- mob run away on low hp?

- some bug remaining with lingering collisions on server

- repopulate equipment properly (recreate objects to at least use instanceof) ?? is that really necessary?

- loot with quantity > 1
	- proper stacking client/serverside

- typechecking on items serverside

- get rid of usesLeft for quantity to take its place

- fix not updating player when invisible, item changes not taking place client side. custom events?

- do containers in game and possible in player backpack

- do buff/debuff queue

CLIENTSIDE:

- write client entities - DONE
- write health popups - DONE
- fix clientX/Y issue in moveQ client - DONE
- split client js files. - DONE
- fix snapback from server when queue-walking (quick double-press into obstacle) - DONE
- write name drawing - DONE
- write exp popups +  broadcasts - DONE
- add entity handlers onclick etc. - DONE
- unknown issue with number popup spam - DONE (peristent keys in server chunks)
- clean up ctx menu code - DONE
- global tooltip flashes/resets timeout - FIXED ITSELF
- right click context menu - DONE
- close loot windows when players moves from the vicinity - DONE

- draw xp bar
- write animations
	- unit -DONE
	- entity
	- short - DONE
	- attack -DONE
	- projectile etc. - DONE


- fix gui bug with s/sw window resize -fixed on github

- globalFakeItem bug. is movable.

- window sticks to nothing


- get rid of DOM/JS redundancies such as items in 2 places ?????????

- client loot windows are really messy, consider using just one window and updating it.

- rewrite client eq? consider rewriting server containers/ equipment (there isnt much in it after all) 
	right now you have to synch client in 2 places and then synch server

- not putting items into entities restriction feels really limiting

- loot with quantity > 1

- add stacking items to match the server logic

- loot windows appearing behind previous when player moved

- containers you can put stuff in - synch between clients?

- trading 

- detecting animation end fail on callend -- peerJS related. possibly fixed
